Deployment
---------
The application is written in plain front-end javascript. To deploy you need a webserver though, which serves the exposed piano key sound file. For example you can use a [simple python http server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server).
